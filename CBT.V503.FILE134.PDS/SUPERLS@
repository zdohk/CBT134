//*  JCL to run SUPERLST - VTOC lister and disk space map utility
//*
//*
//*  The program processes the (first) volume allocated to any
//*  DDname which starts with the string 'VOL'.
//*
//*
//*  Program parameter can contain the following words which
//*  must be separated by commas if more than one is present:
//*
//*  MAP  - specfies that after the data set name and attribute
//*         list (in collating sequence order) a volume space
//*         map is to be produced.  This map may be produced
//*         even without this parameter if the "DOS" bit is on
//*         in the VTOC.
//*
//*  DUMP - specfies that the report is to also include a hex
//*         dump of each VTOC entry.
//*
//*  PDS  - specifies that the directories of all PDSes found on
//*         the volume are to be opened and read.  The reference
//*         date of the PDSes on "modern" systems (OS/390 1.3 or
//*         later, perhaps?) is not updated.  Statistics such as
//*         member and directory block counts are reported.  If
//*         DUMP was also specified then the contents of the
//*         directories are also dumped.
