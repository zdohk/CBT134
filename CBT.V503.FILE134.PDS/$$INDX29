           The IKJT9FI and IKJT9LB modules shipped in CBT file
           135 which can be used to provide the FIND and LISTBK
           subcommands of TSO TEST and are known to work on many
           different levels of MVS from pre-XA to OS/390 2.7,
           have now been found to NOT work on OS/390 2.9.
           (Don't know about OS/390 2.8.)  Rather sad, really.


IKJEFLD3 - TSO Logon Post-Prompt Exit.  This version is used to edit
           the TSO session JCL to put the user's name into the
           "programmer name" field of the JOB card.  The user's name
           is copied from the RACF field pointed to by the ACEE.
           This is for RACF systems only.  Top Secret systems would
           need minor alteration(s).  It is not needed for ACF2 where
           the name is placed into the JOB card by ACF2.  This is a
           much better solution than the TSOPNAME command.
           As a result, JES can tell you a TSO user's name.

           Users' names in print separators.  Hooray!
           (Wish I'd had this 15 years ago....   grumble..  grumble..)
