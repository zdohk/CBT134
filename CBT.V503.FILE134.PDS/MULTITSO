The problem: only one concurrent TSO session is allowed per userid.
If this is satisfactory for your installation then read no further.

************************** WARNING ****************************
If you can't live without the ability to LOGON RECONNECT to
disconnected TSO sessions then read no further.  Installing
this "solution" to enable multiple TSO sessions per userid will
destroy the ability to LOGON RECONNECT to any TSO session.

The appropriate fix is probably to write an IKJEFLD TSO/E Logon
Pre-Prompt Exit performing all the necessary Logon processing
including acquiring TSO user attributes, handling extra logon
command operands, creating the session JCL, etc., etc. all because
it is required if you want to turn on the "bypass enqueue on userid"
bit.

Too hard for me.  Not that I particularly want to replicate all that
stuff which the system does quite well, anyway.  So, the "easy" way:

Implement a front-end to the ENQ SVC (SVC 56) to convert all enqueues
with a major name of SYSIKJUA to SHARED, and use the TSO/E Logon
Post-Prompt Exit IKJEFLD3 to alter the job name in the session JCL.

1) Customise and submit SVC56FE$ to install program SVC56FE which is
   the front-end for SVC 56.

2) Customise and submit SVC56LD$ to install program SVC56LDR which is
   the program to install the SVC front-end.

3) Install a started task to run SVC56LDR.  JCL like
   //SVC56LDR EXEC PGM=SVC56LDR,TIME=5,REGION=1M
   should suffice, assuming the programs are installed into an
   APF-authorised linklist library.  I'll leave it as an exercise
   for you to choose how to run it automatically after an IPL.
   COMMNDxx is good, but what if you want to be able to IPL without it?

4) Customise and install IKJEFLD3.

   Do you want the RACF user name put into the job card?
   If the answer is NO, or if ACF2 does it for you already
   then delete the block of code which does that.

   Install IKJEFLD3 into an APF-authorised linklist library.

5) After installing the SVC front-end (ie. after running SVC56LDR)
   try it out!

6) Congratulate yourself on a job well done.
