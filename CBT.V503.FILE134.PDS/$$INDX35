OFFLMOD  - C program written by Jason Winter to offload load modules
           into REVLMOD format.  Functionally equivalent to a load
           module offload performed interactively by REVIEW, but
           OFFLMOD can be executed as a batch utility or stand-alone
           TSO command.  Under TSO, just type the program parameter
           text as TSO command operand(s) if the program is invoked
           as a TSO command.

OFFLSAMP - Sample JCL to use OFFLMOD in batch.  The sample shows both
           the DSName and DDName specifications.  Either method can
           be used for input and output.  (I guess DDName is best
           practice for batch, while DSName is probably more convenient
           under TSO.  You choose.)


REVIEW   - Release 37.0.  Large scale internal reorganisation.
           See member REVNOTES.

REVMSGS  - Source of REVIEW fullscreen message fetch and
           respository CSECT.


REVLMOD  - Now serialises with linkage editor for better data integrity.
           Source code can still be processed by IFOX00 on MVS 3.8.

REVLSAMP - Sample JCL to use REVLMOD in batch.
