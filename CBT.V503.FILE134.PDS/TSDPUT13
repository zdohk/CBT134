+ %SCAN   +- Scan searches a PDS for a string or a combination of strings. The
+            search argument must be placed in the%PARMS+field. The strings
+            may be related by boolean operators in reverse polish notation.
+            Example: STRING1,STRING2,STRING3,STRING4,OP1,OP2,OP3
+            Valid operators are%AND,OR,ORN(OR NOT),ANDN(AND NOT),
+           %XOR(EXCLUSIVE OR),NAN(NOT AND NOT),NORN(NOT OR NOT).+One may
+            also restrict the members searched by selecting or excluding
+            groups of members by looking only at those members in the%SELECT+
+            field and excluding those members in the%EXCLUDE+field. The names
+            placed in these two fields are%Generic+and must be followed by a
+            blank if they are to be specific. Commas are seperators.
              %Example:+PARMS  %==>+a,b,c,d,e,and,or,or,and
                        SELECT %==>+e ,i
                        EXCLUDE%==>+ims
               This example will look at all members beginning with%I+but not
             beginning with%IMS.+Member%E+will also be selected, since the%e+is
             followed by a blank and is thus not generic. The search criterion
             is as follows:  ((((d and e) or c) or b) and a)
              If these strings are found to match this condition then the
             record will be printed as having satisfied the criterion.
