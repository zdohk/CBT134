  To install 'REVIEW' and 'HEL'/'FSHELP' from CBT file 134:

1)   Install load modules:

     Method 1 - Copy the REVIEW load module and its aliases
                REV, REVVSAM, FSHELP, FSH, HEL, REVED and REVOUT
                from CBT file 135 into your load library.
                (Omit the copy of alias names that you do
                not want on your system, if any.)
              - Also copy support modules REVSMF, REVLMOD,
                PDSLOAD, DELINKI, DWNSPDSR, MINIUNZ.
              - Also copy OFFLMOD which is a related program
                but is not called by the REVIEW command.
                (OFFLMOD can offload load modules to a sequential
                data set in batch or from the command line to
                achieve the same result as REVIEW's OFFLOAD command.)
              - Also copy MINIZIP which is a related program
                but is not called by the REVIEW command.
                (MINIZIP and MINIUNZ are stand-alone utilities/commands
                to perform zipping and unzipping respectively.)

     Method 2 - Make any necessary changes to member REVGEN,
                and customise and run the JCL in either REV$MVS
                or REV$ZOS depending upon the operating system
                to create the main REVIEW load module and aliases.
              - Customise and run the JCL in REVSMF$ to make REVSMF.
              - Customise and run the JCL in REVLMOD$ to make REVLMOD.
              - Install PDSLOAD from CBT file 93 (may 1999 or later).
              - Install the DELINK package from CBT file 90.
              - Compile and link or bind the C program called OFFLMOD.

===> Notes on changing the fullscreen help command name:

     The symbolic variables &HELNAME and &HELNAME2 have been
     provided in the source to simplify this optional task.
     However, program logic may make certain assumptions,
     such as subcommand table sort order, which you may have
     to alter if you use different name(s).

===> End of notes on changing the fullscreen help command name.


     The result either way should be a reusable, reentrant, refreshable
     load module called 'REVIEW' with AC=1, RMODE=24 and AMODE=24.
     It should have aliases: 'REV', 'REVVSAM', 'REVED' and 'REVOUT'
     and the fullscreen help command name(s).

     All members should have the same TTR and entry point
     at offset 0 which should be csect 'REVIEW'.

     If not, then your copy or link did not run correctly.

     Ideal installation location is in the link list.

     As well as the 'REVIEW' program and its aliases, there are
     extra support programs, all of which are fully reentrant:
       REVSMF   - used after 'SMF ON' is issued to format SMF records.
                  Should have a residency mode of 'ANY'.
       REVLMOD  - used when 'PDSLOAD' is issued to reconstruct
                  load modules previously offloaded by 'OFFLOAD'.
       PDSLOAD  - used when 'PDSLOAD' is issued and the PDS being
                  REVIEWed has variable-length or fixed-length records.
                  Source is in member 'PDSLOADW' of CBT file 93.
       DELINKI  - used when 'DELINK' is issued to create object "deck"
                  files from load modules.  Written in PL/I with some
                  Assembler subroutines.  Source is in CBT file 90.
                  Should have a residency mode of 'ANY'.
       DWNSPDSR - BPAM support module for DELINKI.
                  Assembler source is in CBT file 90.

2)   Install TSO CLISTs:

     Copy members 'REVOUTJB' and 'REVTAPE' to a data set in the
     SYSPROC file.


3)   Install TSO help:

     Copy member 'REVIEW#' to member 'REVIEW' in your help file,
     and give it four (4) aliases: 'REV', 'REVED', 'REVOUT'
     and 'REVVSAM'.

     The 'PDS' command may be useful for assigning alias names.

     Also copy the following members to your SYSHELP file:
          REVEDIT#  to  REVEDIT
          REVOUT#   to  REVOUT
          REVPDS#   to  REVPDS
          REVPDSE#  to  REVPDSE
          REVUNIX#  to  REVUNIX

     If you want to use 'FSHELP' then -
     copy member 'FSHELP#' to member 'FSHELP' in your help file,
     and give it aliases of 'FSH' and 'HEL'.


4)   Register TSO commands for general use.

     Update PCF II or similar package if applicable to give general
     users access to these commands.  This step may not be required
     at most sites.


5)   Register 'REVVSAM' as an APF authorized TSO command in member
     'IKJTSO00' of 'SYS1.PARMLIB'.

     This will let you 'REVIEW' physical VSAM components with BSAM.
     This can be useful when catalog/VVDS/CI-control-flags have been
     corrupted, and for looking at physical blocks of non-linear VSAM.

     You could rename REVVSAM to REVAUTH if you wanted to, as it is
     no longer the standard way to REVIEW VSAM data sets.

     Do not APF authorize the "standard" command name(s) (eg. 'REV')
     because then ISPF facilities and TSOEXEC task insulation cannot
     be used.

     If you don't want to use REVIEW to look at subsystem (eg.
     LIBRARIAN with SUBSYS=LAM) data sets or VSAM data with broken
     VSAM control data, then you won't need to APF authorize
     'REVVSAM'.

     APF authorization IS required to REVIEW 'SYS1.VVDS.Vvolser' files.
     APF authorization IS required to REVIEW a BCS as a KSDS.

     Note that even when APF authorized 'REVIEW'/'REVVSAM' issues no
     'MODESET' macros, does not run in a privileged key, nor in
     supervisor state, and in no way bypasses RACF/ACF2 security.


6)   Ensure GDDM modules (usually 'GDDM.SADMMOD' for OS/390 or z/OS)
     are in the link list if you are going to REVIEW Paintbrush
     images on a 3270 terminal with vector graphics (including
     PCLK/OS2LINK).

     (REVIEW loads and references Programmed Symbols itself, but
     calls GDDM to exploit vector graphics.  On a 3270 terminal (real
     or emulated) with both character (ie. symbol or raster) and vector
     graphics, REVIEW will generally load symbols to render small
     images, and call GDDM to render larger images.  Only GDDM Base
     functions are used.)


7)   If you want to be able to select a file in a ZIP archive
     for REVIEW then download and install the MINIZIP package
     (including the MINIUNZ program) from the goodies and updates
     page of the JCC web site at  http://www.jccompiler.com

     **Note: Since the demise of JCC the MINIZIP and MINIUNZ
     load modules can be copied directly from CBT file 135 into
     the execution library, which would be in the linklist ideally.


8)   If you want to be able to run REVIEW as an ISPF application
     then RECEIVE the member REVPLIB and copy all the members to
     an ISPPLIB data set.  Also copy the profile member REVPROF
     into the ISPF profile data set of any user who wants to run
     REVIEW as an ISPF application.

*)   Customization note:

     You may wish to customize the SMF record subtype table at label
     'FSTYPTBL' in the source code.  This could be useful if you
     REVIEW SMF record files and are interested in using 'FINDSMF' to
     not only find a specific SMF record type, but also a subtype of
     that type.  The table is setup for most known IBM-generated SMF
     records, but you can change any entry to suit the records that
     are generated with subtypes at your site.

     It is expected that this will not be needed at most sites.
