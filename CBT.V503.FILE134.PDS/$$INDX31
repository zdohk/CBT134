  This update is geared around getting several programs functioning
  correctly under MVS 3.8J - a free OS commonly run under the Hercules
  emulator.

  In general, the changes mean that load modules transported to pre-XA
  versions of MVS should execute without error.  It does not mean that
  the programs can be assembled by non-XA-aware Assemblers, or with
  pre-ESA MACLIBs.

  MVS 3.8 Base does not include ACF/VTAM.  If ACF/VTAM is not installed
  then the GTTERM macro is not supported (RC=4), and NOEDIT TPUTs and
  TGETs cannot be performed.  Hence access to the Query bit, and the
  capability of issuing Write Structure Field and Read Buffer commands
  are not available.  Further, STLINENO LINE=1 does not cause the
  screen to be erased.

  Without NOEDIT TPUTs SFE and MF 3270 orders cannot be used because
  x'01', x'02' and x'03' (amongst others) which are the most likely
  attribute-value pair counts for such orders are translated to colons
  even for FULLSCR TPUTs.  While it would be simple to "fix" the
  translate table with a USERMOD, it is hard to ensure that all
  target systems for a program would have this USERMOD installed.
  The SA and GE 3270 orders function correctly with FULLSCR TPUTs.
  REVIEW, SNAKE and WORM do not use SFE or MF.


Changes:

1)  The following programs have been changed to explicitly clear and
    reset the screen upon termination under MVS/370:
    REVIEW, SNAKE, WORM and TERMTEST.

2)  The following programs now assume support for extended color,
    extended highlighting, and graphic escape when GTTERM fails:
    REVIEW, SNAKE and WORM.

3)  The following programs have been altered to not execute logic
    paths with XA instructions on pre-XA operating systems:
    REVIEW, REVSMF.

4)  LISTVOL has been changed to use the original LSPACE (SVC 78)
    invocation on pre-ESA systems.  (Support for pre-XA UCB lookup
    was never removed.)

5)  ZAP now has previously omitted zArchitecture opcodes added.
    DISASM instruction format is probably not correct for many.

6)  REVLMOD has now been updated so it can be Assembled by IFOX00.

    As a result, the source of REVLMOD can be transferred to a 3.8
    system where it can be compiled, linked and installed as a batch
    utility.

    REVIEW on a "modern" OS can be used to sequentialise load
    libraries (CBT file 135, for example) into fixed-length 80-byte
    record data sets using the =OFFLOAD subcommand from the member
    list.  (Output sequential file needs to be pre-allocated.)

    Imbedding the resultant sequential file in JCL like:
          //PROGLOAD JOB MSGLEVEL=(1,1),REGION=512K
          //STEP1   EXEC PGM=REVLMOD
          //SYSUT2   DD  DSN=SYS3.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR  <==OUTPUT
          //SYSIN    DD  DATA,DLM=$$
          ...Sequentialised load library data...
    and shovelling the whole lot into READER1 on 3.8 allows load
    modules to be transferred to systems without TSO/E TRANSMIT and
    RECEIVE.

    Notes:
    a. Ensure BINARY file transfers are used (no translation).
    b. Ensure your chosen SYSIN delimiter ($$ in the above
       example) does not appear at the start of any data record.
       (I have seen /* in column 1 from program offloads.)
    c. Ensure load library blocks can fit into the target load library.
       The reconstructed programs are bit-for-bit identical to the
       programs in the source load library.  REVLMOD will terminate
       when a block to be loaded is larger than the target BLKSIZE.
       The source load library can have a block size larger than the
       target's, as long as no blocks are actually larger than the
       target block size.
       For any sort of 3330, the maximum available track size is 13030.
       For a 3350, the maximum available track size is 19069.
       (3330s and 3350s are allowed to use track overflow whereas
       3380s and 3390s are not.  This may allow block sizes larger
       than track sizes, but program fetch may or may not work.)

    An almost identical method can be used to transport PDSs with
    fixed-length records (LRECL ranging from 1 to 80 inclusive)
    except that the reload batch utility on the target system is not
    REVLMOD but PDSLOAD.  If PDSLOAD is not available then IEBUPDTE
    can also be used, but ISPF statistics will not be restored.
