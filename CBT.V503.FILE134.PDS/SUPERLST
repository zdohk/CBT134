    The SUPERLST VTOC listing and space map utility is contained
    in this file (CBT file 134).

    The program may be more properly called XVTCLIST.  This was
    the original load module name with SUPERLST being an alias.

    Since "everyone" used SUPERLST I saw little benefit in retaining
    both names, and so SUPERLST is the member name shipped in CBT
    file 135.

    SUPERLST processing is not affected by APF authority setting.

    The program reads VTOCs pretty quickly - one track at a time.
    If you have a flower box or functional equivalent you can tell
    the size of the VTOC because the track count will equal the
    EXCP count.

    The program issues CVAF macros to process volumes with indexed
    VTOCs.  (Thanks, Rob.)  RTA4BYTE=YES is now used on a CVAFDSM
    macro to handle volumes with more than 65535 tracks, so macros
    from a system capable of handling 3390 model 9 DASD volumes are
    required at assemble time.  (MVS/SP Version 4.3 or later,
    perhaps?)

    Because the latest free MVS available does not use indexed
    VTOCs, the SUPERLST load module is fully functional when
    run on it.  That is, once you have the SUPERLST executable
    program (either from CBT file 135, or assembled by you on
    an OS/390 system, for example) it should work flawlessly when
    run under MVS 3.8J.

    The source members in this data set all have member names
    beginning with 'X'.

    Member XVTOCASM has the JCL to Assemble and Link the program.

    Member SUPERLS@ has sample JCL to run the program.
    Basically, the DDs required are SYSPRINT and a VOLxxxxx
    allocation to each volume to be processed.  Usually,
    PARM=MAP is the only parameter you need.                   GP.
