      Packaging Notes for REVIEW in File 134    (S.Golob - Feb 9,2014)

1.  The entire REVIEW package is available in XMIT format, as
    downloaded from Greg Price's website:

       http://www.prycroft6.com.au/REVIEW/

    These members are in ADDITION to broken-out source members
    which are in this dataset, as before.

    ISPF statistics for members downloaded from Greg's website
    are marked with a userid of REVXMIT.

    Members for Greg's COMPLETE REVIEW INSTALL are:

       REVASM     44.02 2014/02/09 12:45  77229 REVXMIT
       REVCLIST   44.02 2014/02/09 12:52    239 REVXMIT
       REVDATA    44.02 2014/02/09 12:52   2459 REVXMIT
       REVFAQ     44.02 2014/02/09 12:52    544 REVXMIT
       REVHELPX   44.02 2014/02/09 12:52   7670 REVXMIT
       REVIEVME   44.02 2014/02/09 12:52   5663 REVXMIT
       REVNOTEX   44.02 2014/02/09 12:52   1186 REVXMIT
       REVPNLS    44.02 2014/02/09 12:52   3081 REVXMIT
       REVPROF    44.02 2014/02/09 12:52     26 REVXMIT
       REVZLOAD   44.02 2014/02/09 12:52  10626 REVXMIT
       REV370LD   44.02 2014/02/09 12:52   2830 REVLOAD

    The REV370LD member, which contains load modules for REVIEW
    under MVS 3.8j, is in REVLOAD format, and not in TSO XMIT
    format, to make these load modules easier to install on an
    MVS 3.8 system.


2.  To install load modules from the REVZLOAD library, copy
    the following members to your load library:

         S  M=DELINKI
         S  M=DWNSPDSR
         S  M=FSH
         S  M=FSHELP
         S  M=HEL
         S  M=MINIUNZ
         S  M=MINIZIP
         S  M=OFFLMOD
         S  M=OFFLOAD
         S  M=PDSLOAD
         S  M=REV
         S  M=REVED
         S  M=REVIEW
         S  M=REVLEV
         S  M=REVLMOD
         S  M=REVLPDS
         S  M=REVOUT
         S  M=REVSMF
         S  M=REVTOCRD
         S  M=REVVSAM
         S  M=RFE


3.  All source members from the REVASM library are copied as
    individual members to CBT File 134.


4.  The REVDATA members have been copied to CBT File 134.


5.  Member REVLOAD in CBT File 134 contains source code for
    the REVLOAD program (a component of REVIEW source).  The
    load modules for z/OS REVIEW are in the REVZLOAD member.


6.  If you see any further anomalies in the packaging on CBT
    File 134, please email Sam Golob at sbgolob@cbttape.org
