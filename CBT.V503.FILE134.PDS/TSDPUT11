+ The%TSD Utilities panel+provides lots of functions each of which is described
+ in a later panel. The panel allows the user to enter any one of the options
+ beside any of the data sets in the list, thereby requesting that function
+ against the selected data set. All fields are stored in the profile data set
+ and will be preserved between sessions. Only one function is executed each
+ time the enter key is hit, so if more than one option is selected the one
+ chosen will be the topmost one in the list. The exceptions to this are the
+%COPY, RENAME,+and%COMPARE+options. If the topmost option is one of these
+ or, in the case of%COPY+and%RENAME,+one of the associated options%(T or O)+
+ then the program will seek a matching option further down in the list
+ regardless of any other options that may follow it. The%MEMBER+field of the
+ display is optional. If the data set specified is a%PDS+then one may enter
+ an associated member name in this field for certain options. Most options
+ will ignore it, some require it, and still others may operate on members or
+ an entire%PDS.+It is possible, nonetheless, to put the member name in
+ parentheses in the data set name itself, but if one does, one must not also
+ put it in the%MEMBER+field. The%VOLUME+field is for datasets which are%NOT
+%catalogued+or for the%CATALOG+function itself. The%PARMS, SELECT,+and
+%EXCLUDE+fields are for the%SCAN+option and are explained in that topic.
+ The%Command Line+functions as it does in a%standard SPF+panel. For a
+%description+of each of the%functions+hit%ENTER,+else%EXIT+to return to the
