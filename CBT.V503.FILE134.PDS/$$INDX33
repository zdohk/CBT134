$$IEFU83 - Minor changes.  Details in IEFU83 source comments.


REVIEW   - Release 36.0.  Read the release notes in member REVNOTES
           for details.  (Notes for latest release at the bottom.)
           Do not install REVPANEL and REVPROF unless you want REVIEW
           to be an ISPF application for >some< data sets.
           If you want to render pictures in an ISPF environment on
           OS/390 2.10 or later you will need to specify XISPMODE or X.
           UNIX directory entry symbolic link values are now shown.
           REVIEW is now a parallel browser - use the new SWAP

           newer sessions.  Issue 'SWAP LIST' for a session list.
           PFK defaults have been changed.  When REVIEW is an ISPF
           application PFK values are in the REVKEYL ISPF keylist.
